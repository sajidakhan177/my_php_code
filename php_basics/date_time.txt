Get a Time
Here are some characters that are commonly used for times:

H - 24-hour format of an hour (00 to 23)
h - 12-hour format of an hour with leading zeros (01 to 12)
i - Minutes with leading zeros (00 to 59)
s - Seconds with leading zeros (00 to 59)
a - Lowercase Ante meridiem and Post meridiem (am or pm)
The example below outputs the current time in the specified format:

<?php
echo "The time is " . date("h:i:sa");#a is for am and pm 
?>
output 
The time is 06:33:24am

Get Your Time Zone
If the time you got back from the code is not correct, it's probably because your server is in another country or set up for a different timezone.

So, if you need the time to be correct according to a specific location, you can set the timezone you want to use.

The example below sets the timezone to "America/New_York", then outputs the current time in the specified format:

<?php
date_default_timezone_set("America/New_York");#this will set time according to america/New_York
echo "The time is " . date("h:i:sa");
?>

output
The time is 07:06:09am
